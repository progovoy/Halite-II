# Halite Website

## Setup

Assuming you have RubyGems and NPM installed:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby ruby-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev  libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev
    $ cd website/
    $ sudo gem install bundler
    $ bundle install --path=vendor/bundle
    $ npm install
    $ cd ../libhaliteviz
    $ npm install
    $ cd ../website
    $ npm run build
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve
    
Then visit <http://localhost:4000>.
    
If you modify the JavaScript, you might want to run the Webpack watcher, which will rebuild the JavaScript bundle on the fly:

    $ npm run watch
    
To deploy, You will also want a folder with compiled Halite environment binaries. The binaries should be named after the platform they are for, e.g. `MacOS`, `Linux-x64`, and `Windows.exe`. Run `make_starter_kits.py` to generate all the starter kits and source downloads.

Currently, there is no automation for building the offline visualizer.

    $ # Make sure to kill Jekyll and Webpack beforehand, if they're running
    $ python3 make_starter_kits.py path/to/folder/with/compiled/halite/environments
    $ npm run build
    $ bundle exec jekyll build
